How do I confirm my attendance in your wedding? 
You can RSVP right here on our wedding website by clicking the RSVP button. We kindly ask that all guests RSVP by December 15, 2025 so we can plan everything perfectly!

I RSVP-ed but have a change of plans. What should I do? 
Change of heart or schedule? No worries! If you’ve already declined but are now able to join, just send us a message. We’ll check if there’s still space for you to celebrate with us!

Can I bring someone with me? 
We’d love to welcome everyone, but due to limited space, we’re keeping our celebration intimate. We kindly ask that only the names listed on the invitation join us. Thank you for understanding and helping make the day special for all!

Can I bring someone else if my plus one or household member can’t make it?
We totally understand that plans can change! However, invitations are reserved for the guests listed. If your plus one or household member can’t make it, please reach out to us— we’ll gladly assist you from there.

Can I bring my kids during the event? 
To help us fully enjoy our celebration of love, our wedding will be an adults-only event. Little ones from our immediate families and wedding party will, of course, be warmly welcomed.

What time should I arrive? 
We’d love for everyone to be seated and ready before the ceremony begins. Please plan to arrive 30 minutes to an hour early to account for parking, traffic, and a bit of mingling time!

Will there be parking available? 
Yes! Parking is available at both the ceremony and reception venues. Please follow the instructions of the parking attendants at the ceremony and reception venues for a smooth experience. 

Are there nearby hotels in the Ceremony and Reception area? 
Absolutely! There are several hotels and Airbnb options nearby. For convenience, we recommend the Fynn Boutique Hotel. Let us know if you’d like a little help with your booking — we’d be happy to assist!

Can I take photos during the ceremony? 
We invite you to be fully present with us during this special moment. Please keep your phones and cameras away — our professional photographer will capture everything beautifully. Your smiles and presence mean the most to us! 

Can I take photos during the reception? 
Yes, please do! Snap away during cocktail hour and the reception, and share your favorite memories using our official hashtags: #TheweddingofD&R and #D&R2026
